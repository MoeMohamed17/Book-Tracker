# My Personal Project

## Book Tracker

The program aims to manage the reading list of book enthusiasts or soon to be book enthusiasts by keeping track of books they have read or wish to read in the future.
It will offer sorting capabilities, allowing users to organize their reading list based on *genre*, *audience*, *author*, and *literary form*. This will allow users to easily navigate their libraries and discover new reading material tailored to their preferences.

The target audience for this application includes avid readers, individuals looking to develop a reading habit, and anyone in between. By providing a program with a variety of sorting options, it will make it easier to manage reading lists and achieve reading goals. The project is of interest to me as it aligns with my goal of reading more. By developing an application that encourages reading and organization, I hope myself and others are able to explore and expand the literature around us and make reading a more integral part of our lives.
